*Graphene SGX Driver for use with the Graphene Library OS*

This helper repository serves two purposes:

- It contains the sources of the Graphene SGX driver (the GSGX driver).
- It extracts the required C header from the Intel SGX driver (copied as ``sgx.h``).

The Graphene SGX Driver is a Linux kernel module installed under ``/dev/gsgx``. Its sole purpose is
to enable the ``FSGSBASE`` instruction in user space. Current Linux versions do not allow enabling
this instruction from user land, thus the need for this driver. In the future, when support for it
will be added to Linux, this driver won't be needed.

Additionally, this repository contains the script ``link-intel-driver.py`` to find and copy the
required C header from the Intel SGX driver installed on the system. The supported versions of the
Intel SGX driver are:

- DCAP driver, newer versions 1.6+ https://github.com/intel/SGXDataCenterAttestationPrimitives
- DCAP driver, older versions 1.5- https://github.com/intel/SGXDataCenterAttestationPrimitives
- Older out-of-tree non-DCAP driver, only versions 1.9+ https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx-driver

To install the Graphene SGX driver, please run::

    sudo rmmod graphene_sgx || true  # for legacy driver (was previously named `graphene_sgx`)
    sudo rmmod gsgx || true
    make
    sudo insmod gsgx.ko
